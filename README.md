My project analyzes a dataset obtained from Northeastern University’s Affective and Brain Sciences Lab, in which thirty participants in a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scanner were shown images that elicit anger, fear, or disgust after being primed with congruent, incongruent, or neutral emotion words. The brain data files received are preprocessed three-dimensional beta maps, where the value at each voxel is representative of the participant’s level of brain activity during this task. 

I used this data to answer the following research questions:
    Which emotional state can be most accurately predicted across the different priming conditions? 
    How does the priming condition affect the accuracy of our classifiers? 
    Are some similarity metrics more successful for classification than others?
